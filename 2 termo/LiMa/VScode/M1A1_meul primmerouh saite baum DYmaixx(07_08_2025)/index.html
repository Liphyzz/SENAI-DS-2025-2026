                Somebody once told me
                The world is gonna roll me
                I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
                She was looking kind of dumb
                With her finger and her thumb
                In the shape of an L on her forehead
            </p>

            <p style="color: wheat">
                Well, the years start coming
                And they don't stop coming
                Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                Your brain gets smart
                But your head gets dumb
            </p>

            <p style="color: wheat">
                So much to do, so much to see
                So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                You'll never know if you don't go
                You'll never shine if you don't glow
            </p>

            <p style="color: wheat">
                Hey now, you're an all star
                Get your game on, go play
                Hey now, you're a rock star
                Get the show on, get paid
                And all that glitters is gold
                Only shooting stars break the mold
            </p>

            <p style="color: wheat">
                It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
                You're bundled up now
                But wait till you get older
                But the meteor men beg to differ
                Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
            </p>

                The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
                The water is getting warm
                So you might as well swim
                My world's on fire, how about yours?
                That's the way I like it
                And I never get bored
            </p>

                Somebody once asked
                Could I spare some change for gas?
                I need to get myself away from this place
                I said: Yep, what a concept
                I could use a little fuel myself
                And we could all use a little change
            </p>
